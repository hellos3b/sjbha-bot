`[part 1]`

**THE YEAR IS 2018**

The two nations, Pink Bombers and Green Mafia, continue to rage war. This war has gone on for so long, nobody even knows what we're fighting about anymore. Rumor from previous generations claim the war was started with a game of Rock Paper Scissors, but we will never know. We just march on, and continue the tradition of giving valor to those who represent

A small group of outcasts began feeling ostracized by their nation and formed their own group Named The Resistance, they installed tough standards and would only accept those who they claimed worthy. Those who have tried to join but were denied were forever marked as failures.

Once the laughing stock of the two teams, The Resistance slowly grew in support over the months until now, where they have almost as much power as the other two.

These three teams remained the sole powers for months, but as unrest continues to grow, others are looking for another outlet to better represent themselves

**THE MONTH IS DECEMBER**

Some members of Pink Bombers and Green Mafia are beginning to voice their complaints. They are yelling out things like "why are we fighting", "I'm SwItZeRlaNd", and "why are there bird dicks".

They are unhappy about being measured by a value. So they banded together and formed a promise that they don't care how many points each others have.

They call themselves **The Observers**

`!team observers` *(100% chance, person points hidden)*

In a step towards some type of unification, the three nations agreed on a global currency they would all use-- royroybucks. All was well for all but in a few hours, many members in the Resistance began the underground currency scam, exploiting the system in place.  The Resistance went wild and duplicated as much currency as possible without rhyme or reason. This alerted the other two nations and their privileges were quickly taken away.

In what many people call a disaster, some members of The Resistance claimed it was an embarrassment. These people say The Resistance don't stand for the same values they used to stand for, and wanted out. But since Pink Bombers and Green Mafia refuse to take them back, they decided to form a new team.

They call themselves :uprising: **The Uprising**

`!team uprising` *(50% chance, only for Resistance or failed resistors)*

With the Resistance growing in power, Pink Bombers and Green Mafia decided to set aside some difference and join forces to create an elite force that can hopefully maintain the power. This team promises to fight for both nations

They call themselves :guardians: **The Guardians**

`!team guardians` *(50% chance, only for non resistors, 2x total points)*
